Grovery Analytics | Advanced Event Triggers

This plugin is meant to be a supplement to the primary Grovery Analytics setup, providing additional triggers to use for measuring behavior. 

This plugin will require the base Grovery Analytics plugin to also be present, as these are just triggers for the primary analytics event code.
